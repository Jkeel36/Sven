Sven Smart Vending Machine Upgrades

See: https://repl.it/@jkeel36/Java-Sven-version-1-1-Real

Specs: https://github.com/mrminich/Sven

The upgrade that I added was the ability to use lowercase letters to select and option in order for the program to be more user-friendly

'if (userMenuChoice.equals("1") || userMenuChoice.equals("A") || userMenuChoice.equals("a"))'

'else if (userMenuChoice.equals("2") || userMenuChoice.equals("C") || userMenuChoice.equals("c"))'

'else if (userMenuChoice.equals("3") || userMenuChoice.equals("E") || userMenuChoice.equals("e"))'

I also added the ability to play a hidden "Easter Egg" game when the right code word is typed in. This code can be found in the Hangman.java file.
